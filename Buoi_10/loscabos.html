      You might think you know about Los Cabos, but did you know that one of the
      largest, protected national marine parks in the world is just 60 miles
      south? Cabo Pulmo National Park used to be heavily overfished before the
      park became officially protected in the 90s; it's also a UNESCO site
      because of its rich biodiversity, high marine productivity and beauty.
      Cabo Pulmo stretches five miles along the coast of Baja California Sur and
      houses the oldest living reef of on the west coast of North America.
      (Fishermen have been taught how to be dive masters to keep the ocean
      healthy and full of fish.) There, you can find sea turtles, sea lions,
      dolphins and humpback whales. Thanks to the success of the national marine
      park, travelers can now kayak, go stand-up paddleboarding or snorkel/scuba
      dive with sea lions and even (friendly) bull sharks. Back in Los Cabos,
      visit chef Enrique Silva's working organic farm and restaurant at Los
      Tamarindos, where you can pick your produce and make a meal with him.
      There are a number of hotels to check out, including a recently opened
      Montage Los Cabos and the forthcoming Four Seasons Costa Palmas, slated to
      open in 2019. My pick: the sustainable Hotel El Ganzo, which has an
      artist-in-residence program and a music recording studio. The hotel also
      supports the childrenâ€™s community art center across the street.
